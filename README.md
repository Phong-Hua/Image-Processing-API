# Image Processing API

This project is completed as a requirement to pass one of the courses from Udacity Fullstack Javascript Developer Nanodegree program.
Users can go to the url: http://localhost:3000/api/images to request a resized image that is available on the images folder.
Users need to request filename of the image, width and height of the image.
For example:
http://localhost:3000/api/images?filename=fjord&width=200&height=200
will return an image with the name of 'fjord.jpg' and resize to 200x200px dimension.
